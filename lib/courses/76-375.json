      "description" : "In this course, we will read substantial, ambitious articles from a variety of magazines, considering their appeal to wide audiences. Students will write their own magazine articles, working with both their own autobiography and subjects they engage as field researchers. We will also be considering on-line, oral narratives, as a way to expand the concept of what a &#8220;magazine&#8221; is, and students will have the opportunity to create narratives for oral presentation. In this course, you should expect to develop your ability to create a good narrative, to gain experience in the field as interviewer and observer of the world, to become a better editor of your own work and the work of others, and to learn about aspects of culture from a wide variety of contemporary magazine writers. The class is run as a discussion with emphasis on student participation.",
