Example, Fall 2010: This class is somewhat of a continuation of 76-346 Major Works of Modern Poetry although that class is not a pre-requisite for this one. The terms 'modern' and 'contemporary' are arbitrary ones in literary history, with 'modern' tending to mean roughly the period 1900-1925 and 'contemporary' the period after that, 1925&#8212;'60 or '70, roughly. We'll be looking at the post-T.S. Eliot poets, and there is a wide range of significant, interesting and challenging writers to choose from. Our choices might well include some of the following: Elizabeth Bishop, Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, John Berryman, Dylan Thomas, Robert Lowell, Robert Duncan, Lawrence Ferliinghetti, Richard Wilbur, Philip Larkin, Anthony Hecht, Denise Levertov, Kenneth Koch, James Merrill, Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, John Ashberry, Adrienne Rich, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath etc. Clearly we will not deal in depth with all of them, but we will considerably widen our range of reading and understanding the best that has been thought and said in recent times. Our purpose in large part will be to become familiar with the major writers of the 'contemporary' time frame. We will focus our attention primarily on developing our abilities to read and understand poetry, learning the kind of flexible hypothesis-making needed to deal with imaginative uses of language. We will work on training our ears to hear the particular music of individual voices. Which is to say that we will make the 'understanding' of poetry derivative of the musical, or simply artistic, appreciation of it.",
