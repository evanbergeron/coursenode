      "description" : "This is a one-semester course intended primarily for students majoring in Biological Sciences, students pursuing a B.A. degree program in Chemistry, and students in the B.S.A.program with a concentration in chemistry. The course focuses on thermodynamics, transport and reaction rates and their application to chemical and biological systems. Emphasis is given to attaining a good fundamental understanding of entropy and free energy. This is more a concepts than skills building course. Topics include applications of thermodynamics to chemical and biochemical equilibria, electrochemistry, solutions, and chemical kinetics. 3 hrs. lec. Prerequisites: 09106 and 21122 and (33111 or 33106)",
