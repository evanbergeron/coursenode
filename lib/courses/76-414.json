      "description" : "From Shelley's Frankenstein to Darwin's Origin of Species and H.G. Wells's The Time Machine, nineteenth-century literary and scientific writers electrified their audiences with narratives of deep time, speculative futures, and powerful evolutionary logics. Print media intensified the impact of these visions then, as the digital media may be doing again today. This course uses traditional print scholarship along with new methods currently emerging in the 'digital humanities' to grasp the nineteenth century&#8217;s matrix of literary, scientific, and visual culture in a range of fiction and nonfiction texts. Two papers and one visual presentation will be required. (No previous experience in 'digital humanities,' which is an introductory topic in this course, is necessary.) Readings in Darwin, George Eliot, Robert Chambers, Samuel Coleridge, Mary Shelley, contemporary cultural historians of the sciences, and readings in the history of knowledge disciplines and humanistic studies.",
