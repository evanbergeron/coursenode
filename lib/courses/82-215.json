      "description" : "This course is designed to acquaint students with the literature and culture of the Arab world. Through lectures, discussions, and class presentations students will gain knowledge of Arabic fiction and poetry, and examine how these literary productions reflect the cultures, mentalities, and traditions of the Arabs. Students will learn about the religion, social structure, government, and the position of women in the Arab world through presentations of these topics in modern Arabic literature. The course will focus on literature since the beginning of the twentieth century, when the first Arabic novel was published, and also will include a brief survey of older narrative traditions, and how these contributed to modern works. Course grade will be based on a variable assessment method. Students will select from diverse options for writing, presenting, and creative production. With permission of the instructor, it may be possible to earn 3 additional units of credit for work done in Modern Standard Arabic.",
