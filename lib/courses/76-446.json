      "description" : "Topics vary by semester. Fall 2012: Allegory has both a broad meaning involving any attachment of ideas to literary structure and a narrow meaning in which simple morality tales feature characters like Fellowship and Good Deeds. We will make use of both broad and narrow definitions. The long reign of 'realistic' fiction was levered against allegory, which was was often dismissed of as simpleminded, unattractively didactic, and 'medieval.' More recently, sometimes in connection with our current interest in 'alternative universes,' the term and the concept have taken on a new importance in political discourse and in the interpretation of science fiction. The course will consider some medieval, some twentieth century, and some very recent allegories (mostly on film or video), in an attempt to explore theories of both allegorical and realistic narrative modes.",
