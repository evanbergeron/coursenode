      "description" : "This course will serve as an introduction to the history and theory of film. It will cover the history of film from 1895 to the present, focusing on the technological, industrial, and aesthetic development of the medium. It will also introduce students to significant currents of film theory from auteur theory, to psychoanalytic criticism, to recent developments in the philosophy and historiography of film. We will closely trace the development of the American film industry in its relation to other national cinemas, beginning with the earliest films of Thomas Edison, the brothers Lumi&#232;re, and other pioneers of the medium. We will also look at (among other things) examples of classical Hollywood production, Italian neorealism, The French new wave, new German cinema, The new Hollywood, Bollywood, the American blockbuster, new Asian cinemas, and the recent, amorphous category of American &#8220;indie.&#8221; In doing so, we will attempt to define and interrogate the notion of a national cinema. In addition to acquiring overall knowledge of film and film theory, students will develop the skills necessary for critical analysis of cinema and media arts.",
