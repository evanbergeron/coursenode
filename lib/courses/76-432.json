Example, Fall 2011: This course will be an in-depth study of James Baldwin&#8217;s works as well as the writers and thinkers that influenced him. Baldwin&#8217;s rumination on American life during and after the epoch defining events of Civil Rights Era reflects the great political and cultural transformations the country struggled through. In this course students will read canonical works such as Notes of A Native Son and Giovanni&#8217;s Room as well as lesser know works like One Day When I Was Lost, Baldwin&#8217;s screenplay for a never-to-be-produced film project on Malcolm X and Little Man, Little Man: A Story of Childhood, a children&#8217;s novel he published in 1976. Besides Baldwin&#8217;s works we will read and connect Baldwin&#8217;s thoughts on literature, race, sexuality and politics to some of his immediate contemporaries like Richard Wright, William Faulkner, Flannery O&#8217;Connor and others who had an influence on Baldwin&#8217;s imagination and craft.",
