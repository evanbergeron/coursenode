      "description" : "This course will examine the relationship between cognition and consciousness. One particular focus will be on the issue of how complex the processes that are largely unconsciously controlled may be and another is on the interaction of conscious and non-conscious processes in the control of cognition. We will also very briefly examine relevant ideas about consciousness that arise in other fields such as philosophy of mind and physics. The major topics to be included will be drawn from: the experience and functionality of consciousness, neuroscience approaches to consciousness, perceptual and attentional work on consciousness, cognition in altered states of consciousness (in particular, dreaming), implicit memory, and the proceduralization of higher level cognitive processes. The course will consist of our reading and discussing primary research literature from the above areas. There will be a number of short written assignments based on the weekly reading and a term paper.",
