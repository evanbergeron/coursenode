      "description" : "This class will look at the phenomenon of popular song in a francophone context. We will adopt multiple points of view, including not only song as music and lyrics, but song as an event in a socio-historical context, as performance, as an industry, as a means of cultural promotion, as a focus for technical innovation in instrumentation, recording, sound reinforcement, and distribution. Where appropriate we will study and listen to individual artists or groups who exemplify trends in these areas. The second half of the course will move our attention to a survey of regional development, beginning with France, then Quebec and finishing with the Cajun music of Louisiana, in what we hope is not a nod in memoriam to an important part of American culture. Prerequisite: Completion of third year courses or permission from the instructor.",
