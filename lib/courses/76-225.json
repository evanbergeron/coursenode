Summer 2012: This course interrogates the identity of the US military and its members through media representation, and how that identity affects rhetorical situations involving US military and civil relationships. After a sociolinguistic examination of how military members create identity, and are in turn represented in media, we&#8217;ll look for implications of that identity in real world contested issues. For example, how do identities like soldier and Marine affect decisions to allow women to serve in combat, or for gay, lesbian and transgendered citizens to serve as military members? How do popular, influential works like the book and mini-series Generation Kill, or the Turkish film Valley of the Wolves address and impact rhetorical situations like the Abu Ghraib torture? In addition to course readings and discussions, students in 76-3XX will be asked to analyze and then synthesize journalistic, literary, and critical sources in a short interpretive paper, and then a longer research paper that addresses an issue topical to the course. Course Rationale: This course fills several English department programmatic goals, and will be of interest to students because of high current interest in the US military. This is a timely course given US involvement in war and the possibility of another war with Iran. As the UK Independent Postgraduate Edition pointed out in 2010, renewed interest in military subjects mean universities need to address this topic.",
