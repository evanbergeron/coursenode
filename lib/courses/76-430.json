      "description" : "Topics will vary by semester. Spring 2013: Arthurian tales have been told and retold in Anglo-American culture for centuries - they have been appropriated for novels (of which medieval romances are the ancestors), poems, operas, films and visual art of many kinds. The Monty Python group assumed that their satire Monty Python and the Holy Grail would be understood in some detail in order for its humor to be appreciated; the nineteenth century poets and novelists had made the same assumption. It is no exaggeration to say that our own structures of feeling concerning love, sex, and adventure still reflect this influence. This course will juxtapose some of the medieval tales that found the genre with their more recent counterparts, for example Chretien's Lancelot with Malory's retelling of that story in Morte D'Arthur, Tennyson's retelling of Malory, and T. H. White's Once and Future King (the basis of the musical and film Camelot). Recent novels such as Scott Spencer's Endless Love, A.S. Byatt's Possession, and Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose are also set beside their medieval antecedents. Full participation in all class meetings, brief responses to our texts, and two prepared papers are required for everyone in the course; an additional hour for the discussion of critical and theoretical texts is offered for grad students.",
