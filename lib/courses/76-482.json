      "description" : "This course serves a two-fold purpose. It attempts (1) to address the theoretical and methodological issues in cross-/inter-cultural communication from a rhetorical point of view and (2) to examine critically the way comparative studies of different rhetorical traditions/systems are currently conducted. In particular, it is concerned with the rhetorical problems we encounter in trying to write, argue, and persuade across languages and cultures. And it aims to take a close look at the need for rhetoric to rethink its own identity, purpose, formation and agenda in an increasingly multicultural and globalized world.",
