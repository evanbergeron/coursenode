Example, Fall 2011: This course will survey recent American fiction, roughly from 1980 to the present. Many critics have defined the previous era as &#8220;postmodern,&#8221; but no one quite knows what to call this contemporary period, so one purpose of the course will be to define it. We will read stories and novels by writers beginning with the &#8220;minimalism&#8221; of Raymond Carver, reading up to current work by Junot Diaz and Cormac McCarthy.",
