      "description" : "This course provides a rigorous and proof-based treatment of functions of one real variable. The Real Number System: Field and order axioms, sups and infs, completeness, integers and rational numbers. Real Sequences: Limits, cluster points, limsup and liminf, subsequences, monotonic sequences, Cauchy's criterion, Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. Topology of the Real Line: Open sets, closed sets, density, compactness, Heine-Borel Theorem. Continuity: attainment of extrema, Intermediate Value Theorem, uniform continuity. Differentiation: Chain Rule, local extrema, Mean-Value Theorems, L'Hospital's Rule, Taylor's Theorem. Riemann Integration: Partitions, upper and lower integrals, sufficient conditions for integrability, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Sequences of Functions: Pointwise convergence, uniform convergence, interchanging the order of limits. The course presumes some mathematical sophistication including the ability to recognize, read, and write proofs. 3 hrs lec.",
