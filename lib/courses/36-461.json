      "description" : "Epidemiology is concerned with understanding factors that cause, prevent, and reduce diseases by studying associations between disease outcomes and their suspected determinants in human populations. Epidemiologic research requires an understanding of statistical methods and design. Epidemiologic data is typically discrete, i.e., data that arise whenever counts are made instead of measurements. In this course, methods for the analysis of categorical data are discussed with the purpose of learning how to apply them to data. The central statistical themes are building models, assessing fit and interpreting results. There is a special emphasis on generating and evaluating evidence from observational studies. Case studies and examples will be primarily from the public health sciences. Prerequisites: 36-401 (C or better).",
