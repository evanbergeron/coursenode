      "description" : "This course is designed for students who have some basic knowledge of spoken Chinese, but know little of how to read and write Chinese. While students will be trained in all the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing simultaneously, the focus will be on the study and practice of Chinese characters. Based on their speaking ability, students will learn how to communicate in writing in everyday situations. In addition, the acquisition of standard pronunciation and Chinese cultural awareness will also be stressed. After the study of this course students will be well equipped to continue their study of Chinese at the intermediate level. Prerequisite: None.",
