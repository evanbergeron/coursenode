      "description" : "This course is the first in a sequence of four laboratory courses on experimental aspects of chemistry required for the B.S. degree in chemistry. The experimental work emphasizes the techniques of quantitative chemical analysis. Included are projects dealing with a variety of intrumental and wet chemical techniques. The course is project-oriented with the experiments becoming more complex, requiring greater student input into the experimental design as the semester progresses. A mixture of individual and team experiments are conducted during the semester. In addition to techniques, safety, written and oral communication skills, and effective teamwork are emphasized. 2 hrs. lec., 6 hrs. lab.",
