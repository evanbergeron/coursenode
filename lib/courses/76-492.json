      "description" : "In traditional public policy approaches, each step of the policy process from defining a problem to making a case for its solution is assessed in reference to rational models of economic and political actors. This course, however, takes a less conventional rhetorical approach to public policy which focuses attention on the values, beliefs, and argument structures associated with issues as a means of assessing them and as a method for moving forward with effective arguments towards their resolution. Towards this end, we will be studying the theories and analytic methods of both classical and modern rhetoric as well as modern public policy theory. Over the course of the semester, we will combine knowledge and techniques from both fields to examine the development of the public policy debate over the safety and efficacy of nuclear power as a solution to the current environmental and energy security challenges faced by the United States. No previous experience with public policy or knowledge about nuclear power is necessary for this course. Those with experience are welcome.",
