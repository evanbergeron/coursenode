      "description" : "This course explores how Japanese literature has reflected, or has created alternatives to, the reality of Japanese culture and society by analyzing a : variety of fictions primarily from modern and contemporary Japan (e.g., the novels of Haruki Murakami), but also from traditional Japan (e.g., The : Tale of Genji and the literature of Edo era) that spawned the archetypes transformed into its modern/contemporary counterparts. Students will also read essays in Japanese history and literary theory that will provide the tools for interpreting the literature in its own cultural and historical context, and in its interplay with foreign cultures. In addition, this course examines the literature&#8217;s impact on Japanese film. (No prerequisites).",
