      "name" : "Shakespeare: Histories and Tragedies",
      "number" : "76-245",
      "units" : 9,
      "description" : "We will be reading eight plays - three histories from early in Shakespeare's career and five tragedies from later - and some essays on tragic drama. We will try to see these plays: 1) in relation to the culture for which they were written and which they helped shape - the newly established public theater in London, prevailing notions about social class and gender, Puritan attacks on play-going, and the like, and 2) in terms of "what's in it for us" - how current audiences and readers can enjoy and interpret these plays. We will be considering what the plays have to say about the authoritative institutions and discourses of their time, and how they address us now that those institutions and discourses have been replaced by others. Students will be required to attend and participate regularly, submit brief responses to Blackboard, write three prepared essays, and take a final exam.",
