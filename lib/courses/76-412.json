      "description" : "This course approaches a range of literary texts performed and/or published between 1660 and 1800 through the lens of feminist, queer, and performance theories. At least a quarter of our course readings will therefore ground us in these 3 theoretical approaches, while another quarter will be comprised of secondary criticism and history that will guide us in putting that theory in dialogue with this often perversely fascinating period of transition into modernity. The balance of readings will be fiction and nonfiction prose and plays of the period, carefully selected for significance to the cultural history of gender and sexuality. We will be looking at a small selection of canonical novels and plays, but we will also make room for some texts that, while well-known and important in the 18th century, have dropped out of sight in bookstores and theaters of today.",
