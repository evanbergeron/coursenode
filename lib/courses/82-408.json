      "description" : "This course examines the lives and work of the major 20th century artists (Chagall, Cocteau, L&#233;ger, Matisse, Picasso and Renoir) as well as some of their contemporaries who are prominently associated with the art of the Riviera. Considering the artists' personal stories, the course provides a 'social art history' and a multidisciplinary focus which includes an understanding of the historic context, geographic setting, and artistic milieu in which these artists lived and worked, complemented by a conceptual exploration of what a museum is, its physical space and its role in society. The course will be taught in English with assigned readings and related assignments in French for French minors and majors. Prerequisite: None.",
