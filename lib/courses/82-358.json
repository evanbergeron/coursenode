      "description" : "This course examines differences and similarities in the ways literacy is learned and used in diverse languages and cultures. By clarifying the distinct characteristics of spoken and written communications, we will first analyze what was made possible through the invention of writing, and in so doing, explore the social and cognitive consequences of literacy. We will then scrutinize literacy utilization in a variety of cultural contexts, as well as its collective impacts on the users. Lastly, through systematic comparisons of literacy education, we will identify the social, cognitive, linguistic factors, which shape literacy in particular cultural contexts. Prerequesite: None.",
