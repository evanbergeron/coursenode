Example, Spring 2010: Writing in 1542 Bartolome de las Casas 'observed that not a few of the people involved in this story had become so anaesthetized to human suffering by their own greed and ambition that they ceased to be men' and in 1972 Aime Cesaire notes that 'colonization, dehumanizes even the most civilized man.' Writing 400 years apart both men reflect an anxiety towards the social and economic effects of imperial expansion, which stands in sharp contrast to the pro-expansionist attitude of many including government officials and merchants. The aim of this course is to explore the competing understandings of Britain as a nation and an empire, which were expressed throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. We will examine the influence of the British imperialism in the works of authors as diverse as Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, Olaudah Equiano, Jane Austen, and William Makepeace Thackeray. In addition, we will explore theories of nationhood by Srinivas Aravamudan, Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, and Edward Said.",
