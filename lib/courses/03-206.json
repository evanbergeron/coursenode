      "description" : "This laboratory course is designed to provide students with the ability to make measurements on and interpret data from living systems. The experimental modules reinforce concepts from 42-101 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering and expose students to four areas of biomedical engineering: biomedical signal and image processing, biomaterials, biomechanics, and cellular and molecular biotechnology. Several cross-cutting modules are included as well. The course includes weekly lectures to complement the experimental component. Prerequisites: 42-101 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering and 03-121 Modern Biology. Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering. Notes: This course number is reserved for students registered with the HPP program that, are CIT majors. If you require a biology lab for pre-health admissions requirements, please contact Dr. Conrad Zapanta and Dr. Maggie Braun (in the same email) for permission to register for 03-206 instead of 42-203. Priority for enrollment will be given to students who have declared the Additional Major in Biomedical Engineering.",
