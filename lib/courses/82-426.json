      "description" : "SPRING 2013 82-426 German Lit of the 19th Century: The way a nation tells its stories tells us something about its people and the times in which they live. How does the individual relate to the society and the Zeitgeist in which she finds herself? How does the society's past and its prospects for the future shape what it is in the present? In this course we will read and discuss German short stories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. All readings, discussions, and written assignments will be in German. 82-426 B Vienna at the Turn of Century Vienna at the turn of the century (1900) was many things: the political center of the Habsburg dynasty&#8212;the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the meeting place of Czechs and Slovaks, Hungarians and Romanians, Slavs, Poles, Italians, Serbs, Bulgarians and Germans; the center of German-language music and theater; the birthplace of Zionism, of psychoanalysis; the battleground for liberalism and anti-Semitism; the haven for socialism; the home of caf&#233;-culture and the waltz; the garrison for an outdated army; the city of baroque urban palaces and squalid backyard tenements; the center for Enlightenment public policy and reactionary bureaucracy; the showcase for historicism; and the birthplace of Modernism. In an effort to understand today&#8217;s intellectual environment, therefore, we will spend the next ten weeks examining Vienna before the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918.We will start with politics and move on through art, architecture, music, literature, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. Leading us throughout will be Robert Musil's 'Man without Qualities'. At the same time, we will be reading other sources, viewing slides and films, and listening to recordings. Prerequis",
