      "description" : "This course is designed to provide you with knowledge about important theories, issues, questions, and debates concerning the study of gender. Beginning with 'second-wave' feminism, we will trace the theoretical and historical developments of gender to the present, to understand how it continually shifts and structures human behavior, identity, institutions, and power relations. Gender is an intersectional category, so we will be looking at how sexuality, social class, and race and ethnicity shape its meaning. We will use keywords and concepts acquired from academic sources to critically analyze representations of gender found in everyday life such as literature, art, film, music, television, the web, and advertising. Requirements for the course include regular participation and journal entries, a short paper, a presentation, and a final research paper.",
