      "description" : "A central issue in Western philosophy has been whether reason or experience (or some of both?) lies at the foundation of human knowledge, and the 17th and 18th centuries are a defining period of European history because they contribute the basic model of science and the ideals of intellectual and political enlightenment that are still dominant today. Specifically, we will focus on the problems encountered in trying to give an adequate account of the nature of the external world, the structure of our minds, and the nature and limitations of knowledge in the thought of Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley, and Hume. The course has two main goals: (1) to study the metaphysical and epistemological theories of selected philosophers, paying close attention to the arguments offered on behalf of often very strange positions, and (2) to help you improve your analytical and critical skills, including, for example, extracting and evaluating philosophical arguments.",
