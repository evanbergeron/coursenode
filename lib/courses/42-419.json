      "description" : "The goal of this course is to provide students with hands-on experience in investigating host responses to materials. Implant studies of tissue-engineering materials will be performed using animal models in a laboratory setting, and students will gain experience in the analysis of host responses. Material biocompatibility and tissue regeneration will be addressed. Characterization techniques will include histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescent staining. Laboratory work will be complemented with lectures. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing in Biomedical Engineering, or consent of instructor.",
