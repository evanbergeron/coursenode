      "description" : "This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of argument. The session begins with an overview of major theories of (and approaches to) argument, along with short assignments to critically assess their value and relevance to the types of argument about which you, the student, are encouraged to investigate. You will choose a type or genre of argument upon which to focus your research. The argument type can be academic, practical, professional, and so forth, so long as it is understandable using terms and concepts covered by the course. During the second part of the session we will refine our understanding of argument, and you will develop your own approach to argument analysis. The last third of the session will be devoted to producing an original argument of the type you are researching.",
