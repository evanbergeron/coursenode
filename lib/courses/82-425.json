      "description" : "FALL 2013 German Theater, Literature and Film following World War II The three genres we will consider in this course serve not only as a window onto the societies of the German speaking countries following World War II but also as instruments of social change. They reveal social conditions as well as transform them. We will exam works from East and West Germany, Austria and Switzerland and will focus on the contrasts and similarities between the two sides of the &#8220;Iron Curtain&#8221; as well as the unique situation of Switzerland and Austria as neutral nations in a time of heightened political tensions. Reactions to the Holocaust and the destruction of Germany in the war, the ensuing &#8220;Wirtschaftswunder&#8221; in the 1950s and 60s, and the terrorism of the 1970s will be considered. Works by Ilse Eichinger, Peter Weiss, Wolfgang Borchert, Heinrich B&#246;ll, V&#246;lker Schl&#246;ndorff, Margarethe von Trotta and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, among others. Prerequisite: Completion of 82-325 or approved equivalent. Prerequisites: 82325",
