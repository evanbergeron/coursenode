      "description" : "Frank Ramsey played a crucial intellectual role in the Cambridge of Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein and Keynes (just to mention some central figures of the exceptionally lively and creative atmosphere of Cambridge at the beginning of the past century). During his short life (he died in 1930 at the age of only 26) he made decisive contributions to epistemology, decision theory, philosophical and mathematical logic, philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics and philosophy of science. Just to mention an example, his paper `Truth and Probability&#8217; laid the foundations of the modern theory of subjective probability and also those of modern utility theory and decision theory. The entire core of Ramsey&#8217;s philosophical and scientific work consists of no more than 15 papers. But in all cases they are remarkable essays that changed the intellectual topics they touched. Moreover they all contain the same view of philosophy merging a sound portion of Moorean realism with Ramsey&#8217;s kind of pragmatist philosophy. The course reviews these central papers and its rich relations with the Cambridge philosophers of this time and the Vienna Circle. In addition it is remarkable that most of Ramsey&#8217;s views remain valid today almost a century after his death. So, the course considers as well the impact of Ramsey&#8217;s views in contemporary analytic philosophers and those influenced by early American pragmatism. The Ramsey Collection at the University of Pittsburgh comprises an almost complete collection of autograph material by Ramsey, roughly 1.500 autograph pages in all. I am doing some historical research on this material which I intend to incorporate as additional material for the course.",
