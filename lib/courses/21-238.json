      "description" : "An honors version of 21-341 Linear Algebra for students of greater aptitude and motivation. Linear algebra is a crucial tool in pure and applied mathematics. This course aims to introduce the main ideas at a high level of rigour and generality. The course starts with the study of (potentially) infinite-dimensional vector spaces over an arbitrary field, continues with the theory of modules (where the role of the field is now played by an arbitrary ring), and concludes with the development of real and complex inner product spaces. Topics to be covered include: Review of fields. Review of Zorn's Lemma. Vector spaces (possibly in finite dimensional) over an arbitrary field. Independent sets, bases, existence of a basis, exchange lemma, dimension. Linear transformations, dual space. Multilinear maps, tensor product, exterior power, determinant of a transformation. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, characteristic and minimal polynomial of a transformation, Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Review of commutative rings. R-modules. Sums and quotients of modules. Free modules. Structure theorem for fg modules over a PID and applications (Jordan and rational canonical form, structure theory of fg abelian groups). Review of real and complex numbers. Real and complex inner product spaces. Orthonormal sets, orthonormal bases, Gram-Schmidt. Examples: F^n and l^2(F) for F = R; C. Operators: Symmetric/Hermitian and Orthogonal/Unitary operators. Spectral theorem. Quadratic forms. Singular value decomposition. Possible additional topics (time permitting): applications to combinatorics, category theory, representations of finite groups, normed spaces. 3 hrs. lec.",
