      "description" : "At one level, language is constituted by nothing but sounds, or marks on paper. How can such physical objects be used to create or transmit meaning? The answer assumed in this course is that objects with specific physical features are assigned symbolic or linguistic values on the basis of those features. By the juxtaposition of such objects (phonemes or graphemes), larger symbolic objects are created (morphemes). These larger objects have the special property that they can be associated in a consistent way with meanings. In a progressive fashion, words are built from morphemes, phrases from words, and sentences from phrases. The symbolic object of special importance in language is the sentence &#8212; this is the minimal object that encodes information. Sentences have different moods, and these moods correspond to their function with respect to the encoding and transmission of information. Indicative sentences carry information, interrogative sentences request information, imperative sentences demand action, conditional and modal sentences present alternative possibilities, and so on. The goal of this course is to investigate the association of sound and meaning (or marks and meaning) in stages, beginning with the combinations of phonemes or graphemes into morphemes, and moving on to the construction of larger syntactic entities, ultimately sentences. Building on material taught in Nature of Language, formal theory in the areas of morphology, syntax, and semantics is introduced as we proceed, and as motivated by the linguistic forms under analysis. The endpoint involves the representation of meaning in language, and a consideration of what information is, such that it can be encoded in and transmitted by simple physical entities.",
