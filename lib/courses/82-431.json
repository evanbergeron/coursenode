      "description" : "FALL 2012 This course takes a look at the multifaceted relationship between China and the Western world from Marco Polo&#8217;s time to the present. The focus will be on how people in China and the West imagined each other in different times of history and in what ways some historical events and figures, as well as concepts and cultural practices are interpreted differently from Chinese and Western perspectives. Students are expected to reach a deeper understanding of the complexities of cultural interactions and their implications for the diverse world in which we now live. The students will read a rich collection of scholarly writings, and the class will be conducted primarily in discussion format. The class is conducted in English and Chinese. Students will complete readings in both English and Chinese. Assessment will be based on participation in the discussion, student presentations, and written assignments (including research papers, book reviews, and translations). Prerequisits: 82-332, or instructor's approval.",
