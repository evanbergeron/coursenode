      "description" : "The purpose of the course is to explore the biographical facts, political circumstances and cultural histories underlying the paradoxical and poignant trajectory of Joseph Brodsky's outstanding achievements as poet, playwright, essayist and spokesman for literature's value to ethics and education. His work is deeply rooted in the artistic efflorescence of the 'Silver Age' in twentieth century Russian poetry, but takes equal inspiration in the metaphysical poetry of England's Renaissance and Modern ages. To read Brodsky is thus to read Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva and Osip Mandelshtam, on the one hand, and John Donne, George Herbert, T.S. Eliot, and W.H. Auden on the other. Works by and about these authors as well as Brodsky thus comprise the reading matter of the course. Poetry, essays and literary criticism are read with a view toward textual explication as a starting point for engaging the larger issues by which any literature subsists. To study the career of this most unusual writer in its bilingual, bicultural context is to confront the most fundamental questions about the means by which cultures are empowered and the reasons for which they succeed or fail to coexist in any given place and time. The language of the course is English for all readings, lectures and discussions. No knowledge of Russian is required, but those who can are invited to read in Russian as well. The course follows a predominantly seminar format. Reading and writing assignments are required, as is participation in classroom discussion. Prerequisite: None.",
