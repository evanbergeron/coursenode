      "description" : "Until recently, the dominant view of international relations among both academics and politicians was that governments and citizens of one country have no moral or legal obligations to anyone beyond their own borders. The later half of the 20th century has seen a dramatic change in this attitude, with a much greater willingness to recognize that demands of justice may transcend national borders and bind different states and their people. This course examines this shift through the lenses of history, philosophy, law, politics, and anthropology. It is being offered in conjunction with the 2009-2010 Humanities Center Colloquium Series on 'Global Connections, Global Responsibilities.' Topics covered include: theories of justice; sovereignty; the universality of human rights; global inequality and poverty; trade and labor in the global economy; climate change; humanitarian intervention and just war; post-conflict reconciliation and social reconstruction; as well as the emergence of transnational modes of governance. In addition to several short writing assignments, students will have the opportunity to carry out a research project on a relevant topic of their choice.",
