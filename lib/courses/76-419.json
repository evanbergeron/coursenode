      "description" : "What does it mean to be living in today's communication technology 'revolution?' In a time when many forms of communication are digitally based, traveling as bits at e-speeds on global computer networks? To begin answering that question, we will examine the origins and historical development of various communication revolutions&#8211;from the invention of writing, the printing press, the telegraph, and so forth&#8211;to the Internet. The discussions and readings will seek to provide a comprehensive overview of how so-called communication revolutions developed, with discussion of cognitive, social, political, economic and technological aspects. We will attempt to put the development of communication technologies in their historical context: How were new forms of communication received? How were they used? How did they affect communication? How did they influence political and social institutions? We will focus, however, on relating historical developments to current digital communication developments. We will take as case studies several new discursive digital formations: digital books, on-line newspapers, and possibly global non-government organizations (NGOs), such as non-profit environmental activist organizations. Along the way we will ask questions such as 'What should a rhetorical theory that takes media into account do?' What are some of the challenges that new digital formations present to traditional rhetorical theories (e.g., How is 'ethos' established when speakers are anonymous and globally distributed? How is the 'public sphere' constituted when Internet search engines dynamically construct it?) (Please see English Dept. for full description.)",
