      "description" : "This course, which includes demonstrations and 'hands-on' activities, is designed to engage non-majors in the fascination of chemistry. It is not essential that a student has completed 09-103 in order to take this course. The lecture part of this course will include wide ranging science topics designed to put the world of chemistry in perspective. After achieving a competency in fundamentals we proceed to systematically survey the important topics of synthesis, structure and mechanism in organic chemistry. With these insights we finally confront the important biological molecules including DNA. 3 hrs lec.,1 hr rec.",
