EXAMPLE Spring 2012: This course will survey American fiction from 1945 to 1980. 'Post-1945' has typically been the catch-all to describe American literature after the modernist period, and has often been called 'contemporary.' However, that designation now seems inadequate: writers who became prominent in the immediate postwar era are historically removed, and writers arising since 1980 form a distinctly different generation, with a different sensibility. This course will account for the immediate postwar period, with the working hypothesis that we need to create a new construal of American literature and its recent past. It will look at authors such as Norman Mailer, Flannery O'Connor, Saul Bellow, John Updike, and Thomas Pynchon.",
