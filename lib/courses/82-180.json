      "description" : "Picasso and Matisse: Artistic Friends or Foes? Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso were arguably the greatest of the 20th century Europeans artists. Opinions are divided as to which was the greatest. They first met in Paris in1906 and continued their contact - sometimes personal, sometimes via friends, dealers and collectors, sometimes by &#8220;spying&#8221; on each other&#8217;s work from that moment until Matisse&#8217;s death in 1954. Much has been written about their relationship, their influence on each other and whether or not they were really friends or foes. This course will examine closely the work of each of these two masters within the context of 20th century European art. It will look at them individually and comparatively, studying their paintings, sculpture, work in clay and glass as well as their personal relationship. Readings will include personal testimony from those who knew them well, traditional art history texts, several catalogues from major exhibits that compared their work and several videos from these exhibits. Students will be expected to become familiar with the major contributions each of these artists made to 20th century art as well as to the cultural milieu in which they lived and worked.
