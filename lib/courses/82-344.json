      "description" : "The purpose of this course is to provide review and practice of the four skills ? reading, writing, listening and speaking ? at the advanced level, in Spanish. All work in this course, in the four skill areas, will be stimulated by and be the product of an advanced introduction to and analysis of the cultures and histories of the Hispanic peoples in the United States of America. Many of these people have been and are native born; others are descendants of natives and/or colonizers who resided in North America prior to the arrival of Anglo-Germanic peoples. Many havae migrated from Mexico, the Hispanic Caribbean, Central and South America, and Spain during the past two centuries, for economic and/or political reasons. Still others have migrated under special circumstances, as exiles escaping from repressive regimes or from wars in their homelands. Our exploration of U.S. Latino history and culture will compare and contrast the experiences of Hispanics from all three of the above-described categories and analyze the dynamic tension amongst them, with other minority groups, and with the mainstream society. Prerequisite: Completion of the intermediate level or equivalent or permission of the instructor.",
