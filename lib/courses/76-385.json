      "description" : "Discourse analysis places a primary focus on how things are said; and this close attention to the details of 'language in use' can offer insight into a variety of questions posed by researchers across the humanities and social sciences. In this course, we will examine the way discourse is itself a form of social action that plays a fundamental role in organizing social, cultural, and political life. In addition to becoming familiar with a variety of approaches and topics in the study of discourse, a major aim of the course is for you to develop the tools and skills needed to analyze actual discourse data. This will involve learning how to read transcripts and transcribe data at different levels of detail, learning how to ask questions about the data based on different analytic interests, and developing a vocabulary of scholarly terms and concepts that will allow you to comment on discourse features as you formulate interesting and persuasive claims. The first part of the course will involve assignments with shared data to develop fundamental skills. In addition, seminar participants will be responsible for selecting pieces of discourse for mini data sessions throughout the semester. For the final assignment, you will choose and analyze a piece of spoken or written discourse of interest to you. In the end, you should come away from the course with an ability to think critically about the way discourse operates in the world.",
