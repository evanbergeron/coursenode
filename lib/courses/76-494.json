      "description" : "Healthcare Communications is a writing-intensive course designed for students interested in how healthcare information is developed by researchers, healthcare providers and writers and communicated to patients and their families, the general public, and other experts. Throughout the course, we will explore where people find medical information, how they use and evaluate it, and what challenges writers face in supporting informed healthcare decisions while communicating ideas that can be complex, provocative and sometimes frightening. We will read and discuss published literature dealing with issues in health literacy, clinical research, and patient care. We will also learn the basics of reading, understanding, and interpreting the research literature and communicating research findings to non-experts. Early in the semester, you'll choose a medical area of interest that you will research using sources such as journals, articles, books and web sites, as well as direct contact with appropriate medical, healthcare, and/or research professionals. For your final project, you will write and design materials that will meet a specific need or gap you identify in existing information. The final project could be a magazine article, a website, patient education material such as brochures or training materials, or another vehicle that emphasizes accurate, informative and engaging writing. In addition, there will be several short writing assignments to build the research and writing skills needed to effectively communicate healthcare information. A background in health, medicine or science is not necessary for this course, but a willingness to learn about these areas is essential.",
