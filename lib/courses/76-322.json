      "description" : "This course looks at the writings and experiences of South Asians (people from the Indian subcontinent and its environs) living in such places as the United States, Britain, and the Caribbean. During the semester, we will read literary works alongside histories of South Asian immigrants and theoretical works about diaspora. In the process, we will consider such themes as identity, immigration, race, class and globalization. We will examine the histories of migration and study how the experience of living between two homelands has been theorized. In addition to examining diasporic literature, the course will investigate present day South Asian global cultures including popular culture, film, music, and dance. Possible readings include works by V.S. Naipaul, Hanif Kureishi, Meera Syal, Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri, Nadeem Aslam, Mohsin Hamid, and Michael Ondaatje.",
