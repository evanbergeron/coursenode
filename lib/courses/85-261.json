      "description" : "The study of psychopathology is not an exact science; nor are there many clear-cut parameters with which to differentiate 'normal' and 'abnormal' behavior.&#160; This course will focus on learning about and understanding the range of behaviors which fall within the province of 'abnormal' psychology. Its approach will be descriptive, empirical, theoretical and conceptual. Students will examine definitions of ?abnormality? in an historical and contemporary context, explore issues relevant to diagnosis and patient care, be introduced to various psychological diagnostic categories, and develop an appreciation of the range of treatments for these disorders.&#160;.",
