      "description" : "The science of economics has come to occupy a central position in contemporary society &#8211; no other science gives rise to such heated emotion. Because of its central position in contemporary political rhetoric, economics becomes intertwined with a number of other philosophical issues surrounding justice, rights, and fairness. This course will look at foundational and philosophical questions that arise in the study of economics and application of economic theory to political problems. We will address issues like, the testability of economic claims, the use of &#8220;rationality&#8221; postulates in economics, the foundation of the right to property, the ability and inability of markets to solve social problems, and measuring the success or failure of an economy.",
