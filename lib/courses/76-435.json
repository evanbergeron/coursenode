Consult the course descriptions provided by the department for current offerings Example, Fall 2010: Before the Beat Generation there was the Lost Generation. Both moments of literary history have an important relevance for our time, and both produced many major literary works. The 20's, like the 50's and 60's were marked by the effects of World War. Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation-naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, 'You are all a lost generation.' Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of 'irony' as the central quality of modern identity. Of course, the 'lost' generation wasn't really lost even if it was searching for new ways of understanding experience. And 'beat' generation wasn't beaten down either. And irony wasn't invented yesterday even if it still is a dominant mode of modern experience. The last generation to have a really significant name, the beat generation was marked in part by an interest in jazz, and an intense interest in the power of writing. Writing was both a form of recording a response (often oppositional, often ecstatic) to what was going on in the world, and it was also a way of re-inventing the world by discovering some kind of previously hidden secret that only 'writing' could uncover. There is a continuing interest in beat writing these days, days which are usually taken to be characterized by a decline in print literacy accompanied by a growth in force of electronic media. So, amongst other things, reading the Beats offers us an opportunity to explore our own times, as well as to read (or-read) a body of powerful visionary literature from the recent past.
