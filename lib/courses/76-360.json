      "description" : "Literary Journalism is a form whose tradition dates back to Dickens. It takes as its subject 'ordinary people,' and reveals lives fully, implicitly or explicitly making connections between the personal, political, and historical. The course will acquaint you with some classics of the form, along with contemporary work by writers who are writing this 'literary' journalism using all the tools of the fiction writer. We will read books by writers who have spent considerable time in the field as researchers to bring us stories of so called ordinary people who might serve to enlighten or reveal something about the world. Students will be asked to do field research throughout the term addition to their writing and reading assignments. All students will also produce an oral presentation of one of these assignments.",
