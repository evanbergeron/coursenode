      "description" : "Though rhetoric of science can be traced back to Philip Wander&#8217;s 1976 article &#8220;The Rhetoric of Science,&#8221; the field came into its own in the 1980s with the work of Joseph Campbell and was expanded in the early 1990s through the efforts of Alan Gross, Jeanne Fahnestock, Carolyn Miller and others. Since then, the field has become a vibrant new area of research in the discipline of rhetoric. Rhetoricians of science study various aspects of science including the importance of language and argument to the development of scientific knowledge, the use of rhetorical argument in science, and the process of communication within and scientific disciplines as well as between scientists and the public. : In this course, we take the broad view of the rhetoric of science. We will examine many facets of scientific communication including scientific audiences, visuals, and conventions for argument. By exploring these elements of science we will begin to develop the sophisticated understanding of scientific communication and argumentation necessary for undertaking complex rhetorical analyses. Specifically, we will be driven by questions such as: &#8226;: How do scientists argue their case with one another? &#8226;: How is scientific information and argument transformed when it is accommodated for popular arguments? &#8226;: How does the social and historical context in which science is done shape the way that science is communicated and/or argued? &#8226;: In what ways do the language and style shape scientific knowledge and communication? &#8226;: What argumentative solutions can visuals supply in science and what argumentative problems",
