      "description" : "Topics will vary by semester. Fall 2012: New media isn't new; old media isn't dead. The term 'new media' itself presumes that a wholly original technology replaces another outdated one. This course will trace a history of media change from 1844 to the present day, or, roughly from the telegraph to the iPad, though we will dedicate the bulk of our attention to the mid to late twentieth century. Rather than accept a straightforward linear narrative of innovation, we will, instead, privilege use, reception, and context. The class will also explore various 'dead media,' technologies that got left behind in the march of progress towards the digital. By approaching the very idea of new media critically, the class intends to deepen students' understanding of both the historical and contemporary position of the digital media we rely upon to interact with the world around us. While the course readings will be comprised primarily of theoretical and historical approaches to media, we will also draw off many primary sources such as science-fiction, classics of American literature from writers such as Walt Whitman and Thomas Pynchon, as well as documents in which technical pioneers such as Alan Turing outline the form and function of concepts and devices that directly shape modern day computing. Since this course will cover multiple forms of media, students will be expected to develop methods to deal with the specifics of each medium. Students will keep media journals chronicling their interaction with various forms of media - new and old - and experiment with a small sample of digital archives and digital production software in order to complete a case study midterm project on an overlooked medium (or aspect of a medium) of their choice.",
