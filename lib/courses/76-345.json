      "description" : "In the age of Shakespeare and Milton (the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), poetry, international politics, and theology were far more intertwined than they are today. While dedicated primarily to poetry, this course will investigate the implications of this intertwining in practice. Seeking to do justice to the true interdisciplinarity of Renaissance poetry, the course supposes that poetry and verse technique mattered so much in the period due to questions spanning art, politics, and theology of how power (verbal power, divine power, political power) should be represented. Biographically, many canonical poets we'll study in the course worked as ambassadors, representing power abroad (Wyatt, Sidney, Donne, Marvell). Many more poets including Shakespeare and Milton thematized diplomacy, in both its divine and more worldly forms ('angel,' in fact, means 'messenger'). Poetry too was seen in similar terms. As Coleridge would later write, poems were 'the envoys or representatives of&#8221;vital passion.' Readings including Shakespeare's Hamlet, Milton's Paradise Lost, and John Donne's 'The Ecstasy' will be introduced and contextualized through writers such as Pseudo-Dionysius, John Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Alberico Gentili, and George Puttenham. Topics to be considered will include historical poetics, divinity, sovereignty, immunity, license, fidelity, craft, and accommodation. Assignments and class discussions will be occasions to practice historically-informed criticism; to compare conceptual structures within seemingly distinct domains of history and thought; and to articulate major fissures and changes in Renaissance angelology, diplomatic practice, and literary craft.",
