It has been said that the teenager is the most free and least happy of all living beings. Given America's current obsession with youth culture, it's hard to imagine a time when the word 'teenager' did not exist. However, this word came into being largely as a result of the post World War II boom in consumerism when advertisers needed a new way to define an emerging demographic group with its own disposable income and spending power. Through a survey of twentieth century literature that focuses on the teenage experience, we'll explore the changing meanings of young adulthood over the last one hundred years. What is the relationship between the invention of the teenager and modernist aesthetics? What characteristics were considered markers of young adulthood in the 1920's? In the 1950's? In 2000? How are the experiences of angst, anomie and the unfulfilled American dream connected to modern Western life through the teenage subject? How do tropes of individualism, rebellion, freedom and resistance connect the literature of teen angst with other genres of American literature? How has teen angst been both an impediment to and the inspiration for cultural resistance and social change? To answer these questions, we will compare texts such as Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint, Anzia Yezierska's The Bread Givers, J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, Margaret Atwood's The Edible Woman, Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, and Banana Yoshimoto's Kitchen.
