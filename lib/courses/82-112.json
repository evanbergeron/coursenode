Regular participation in class is mandatory (four in-class hours per week). In addition, students will be required to spend some time in the Modern Language Resource Center (MLRC) using different multimedia tools to complete assignments. Information on how to use these tools will be provided.

If a student has studied Arabic before, then s/he must take the placement exam. Instructions for taking the placement exam are in Baker Hall 160. Prerequisite or appropriate placement test score.",
