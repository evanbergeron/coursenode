      "description" : "An introduction to the fundamental principles and methodologies of classical feedback control and its applications. Emphasis is on problem formulation and the analysis and synthesis of servomechanisms using frequency and time domain techniques. Topics include analytical, graphical, and computer-aided (MATLAB) techniques for analyzing and designing automatic control systems; analysis of performance, stability criteria, realizability, and speed of response; compensation methods in the frequency domain, root-locus and frequency response design, and pole-zero synthesis techniques; robust controller design; systems with delay and computer control systems; transfer function and state space modeling of linear dynamic physical systems; nonlinearities in control systems; and control engineering software (MATLAB). 4 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec.",
