      "description" : "Leadership is often associated with the exercise of institutional authority or individual power. However the tradition of leadership based on dialogue shows us a powerful counter-rhetoric&#8212;one which organizes people to work together on complex problems through problem-posing, pragmatic inquiry, and the inclusion of marginalized perspectives. We will examine how this approach to leadership and change works in public voices of writers from Emerson and Martin Luther King, to the community organizing of an Alinsky, to the cultural critiques of African-American and feminist scholars such as Cornel West or bell hooks, and&#8212;equally importantly&#8212;in the ways ordinary professionals include voices and integrate social values into effective workplace writing, and the ways students call forth change on campuses. This introduction to the rhetoric of making a difference shows how its roots in American philosophical pragmatism created a focus on outcomes, not just ideals, and translated commitments into strategic rhetorical practices. In this course you will develop your own skills in writing and leadership by working as a &#8220;rhetorical consultant&#8221; to a campus or community group: learning how to investigate and define a shared problem, to develop a briefing book for deliberation, and to support inclusive decision making by documenting rival perspectives and options (see <a href='http://www.cmu.edu.thinktank'>http://www.cmu.edu.thinktank</a>). This portfolio project will also demonstrate your research skills and ability to support a problem-solving dialogue within an intercultural community or complex organization.",
