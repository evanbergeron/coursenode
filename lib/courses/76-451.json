Consult detailed course descriptions available from the Department each semester for details. May be repeated for credit. Fall 2011: The linguistic and social history of the English language from its earliest attestations until the global spread of English and the emergence of the spectrum of &#8220;Englishes&#8221; in the modern world. We will single out some of the critical periods of change and study them for their linguistic and sociocultural significance. The periods studied will include: the Germanic background; Old English; English from the Norman Conquest (1066) until the introduction of printing (1476); Early Modern English; Present Day English. We will study short texts characteristic of their time and examine linguistic and sociocultural features diagnostic of their age, social class, and region.",
