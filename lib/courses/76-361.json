      "description" : "Topics will vary by semester. Consult detailed course descriptions available from the Department each semester for details. Fall 2006: Students will take on the project of planning and managing a film festival that draws a college- and city-wide audience. The class members will collaborate on all aspects of the festival: selecting films, generating and distributing marketing materials, designing and scheduling events, arranging facilities and general logistics, coordinating internal and external public relations, organizing fundraisers, rallying the local communities &#8212; in short, all the aspects involved in making the event a spectacular/sensational success! The theme of 2006's festival is Freedom and Democracy. In examining some of the world's best feature films and documentaries on this theme, we shall emphasize countries in political transition: where the dilemmas of contemporary Democracy are most apparent, such as Israel, France; where the practice of Democracy is recent, such as Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic; where it is only now being introduced, such as Iraq, Afghanistan. A unique feature of this course-cum-festival will be several directors' participation as guest speakers on the democratic - and other - issues informing their films. Since this is not a typical academic class, there will be neither final exams nor research papers. Instead, the instructor will base grading on short papers, commitment to the project, and class discussion. The best papers as intro to the films will be published in one of the city papers.",
