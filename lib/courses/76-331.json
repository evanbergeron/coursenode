Ghosts, monsters, prodigies, demons, and other strange phenomena: many of these so called 'preternatural' occurrences were becoming the object of overlapping (and sometimes conflicting) forms of explanation during the seventeenth century. Whereas some of these phenomena could be explained philosophically - with reference to natural causes - others belonged to religious debate or seemed exclusively to exist in the imagination. Using a broad range of texts, we will examine the widespread interest in the preternatural in seventeenth century culture, exploring the political, religious, and ideological consequences of this fascination. Texts for the class will include images of natural 'marvels' and 'monstrosities,' collections of 'curiosities,' plays by William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, utopian fiction by Margaret Cavendish, selections from Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, seventeenth century crime pamphlets, philosophical texts by Francis Bacon, Robert Hooke's images from the microscope, readings in Renaissance and classical poetics, and various religious texts. Students can expect the reading for this class to be demanding but interesting. Several written assignments, a final exam, and conscientious participation in class discussion will be required.",
