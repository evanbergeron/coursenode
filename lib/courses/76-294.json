      "description" : "This course introduces students to the theories and practices of interpretation. Combining the approach of critical theoretical study with close textual analysis, we will consider how meaning is produced through language and narrative. Theoretical approaches include those that explore the role of the author, those emphasizing the workings of language, such as structuralism and post-structuralism, as well as those that underscore the relationship between texts and contexts, such as feminism, critical race theory, and postcolonial studies. Critical readings will be read alongside literary works from multiple genres and cultural contexts.",
