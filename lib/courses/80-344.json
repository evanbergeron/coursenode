      "description" : "This course examines and poses answers to the following question: 'What are the legitimate environmental responsibilities of organizational managers from the private, public and nonprofit sectors and how can they be best fulfilled?' This query will provide the course with its major theme and framework. But in order to do justice to it, three interrelated areas that are presupposed by this question will need to be explored first. These areas are: 1) applied ethics, 2) management ethics and 3) environmental ethics. The first half of the course will concentrate upon these three areas. The second half of the course will focus upon management and the environment employing the insights gained during the first half. Here students will review and evaluate past and current management practices with respect to the environment, organizational policies dealing with the environment and the role of government in the process of determining environmental responsibilities in management. Environmental concerns on the international level and their impact upon organizational management, the emergence of the 'environmental affairs manager' within organizations, balancing environmental responsibilities with other management responsibilities and examples of management responses to the environmental crises will also be examined during this portion of the course.",
