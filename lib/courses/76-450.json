Example, Fall 2011: 'I'm not a lawyer, but&#8221;' How many times have you heard this disclaimer, closely followed by a lay analysis of law? This course, an introduction to the cultural study of law for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, can be seen as an introduction to what goes into the making of such a statement. Where do we get our ideas about law? What do we mean when we say &#8220;law&#8221;? What counts as law? How does culture influence law, and law, culture? And to what degree must history condition any answers we might be tempted to give? Students in the course will study works in a range of genres (novels, plays, poems, judicial opinions, pamphlets) and develop methods for investigating ways that law and culture have been made by one another from the 16th-century to the present. Readings will include influential theoretical accounts of law (Aristotle, Hobbes, Kant, E.P. Thompson, Habermas, Hart, Derrida, MacKinnon) and canonical texts in &#8220;Law and Literature,&#8221; such as Shakespeare&#8217;s Measure for Measure. As a counterpoint to the fiercely ahistorical &#8220;law and economics&#8221; movement, however, the course will put special emphasis on rooting intersections of law and culture in rich historical context, considering both local and international legal contexts (sometimes in highly technical detail) alongside so-called &#8220;ephemera&#8221; of culture. Students will tackle the especially fruitful &#8220;case&#8221; of Renaissance Britain before developing their own final research projects, whether on the Renaissance or another period of their choosing.
