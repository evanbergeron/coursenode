We will explore how testimonios, documentary film and photojournalism have been utilized to struggle for justice and to inform the practices of memory. Students will do theoretical and critical readings, as well as analyze a variety of materials, including court documents, photos, film and testimonios. Some readings are in English but most are in Spanish, thus an advanced intermediate level of reading knowledge is required. Open to one or two students.",
