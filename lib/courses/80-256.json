      "description" : "This course will address some of the central aesthetic theories concerning the nature of our judgments of the beautiful and of the sublime that were developed around the 18th century. The famous divide between the British empiricist philosophers and the rationalist philosophers of the Continent regarding the sources of human knowledge, was paralleled in a dispute regarding the nature of aesthetic judgments. In this course we will study the aesthetic theories of some of the most important figures of this period, with an emphasis on the work of Immanuel Kant.",
