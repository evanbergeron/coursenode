      "description" : "This course introduces students to the basic outlines of the Faust story, and examines its nineteenth- through twenty first-century manifestations in a variety of European, Russian and American novels, plays, films and operas. On the assumption that cultures reveal something distinctive about themselves by the particular way in which they adapt the legend, this course aims to discover how and why these Faustian works of art respond and contribute to the social, political and historical context in which they are produced. On what is the persistent appeal of the Faust legend based? To what needs does it speak? How does the history of its own, continual reemergence affect the meanings it communicates? Prerequisites: None for 9 units; an additional 3 units, requiring permission of the instructor, can be earned for work done in Russian.",
