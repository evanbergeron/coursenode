      "description" : "FALL 2012 82-333 Introduction to Chinese Language and Culture &#8220;Modern Chinese Culture&#8221; This course will introduce students to important developments in China&#8217;s culture and language since the end of the nineteenth century. We will focus on the interactions between Chinese and Western cultural traditions and the historical, social and political contexts in which these interactions evolved. Thus we will explore questions like: What is Chinese culture in the modern world? What is &#8220;modern&#8221; and what &#8220;traditional&#8221; Chinese culture? How does high culture interact with folk culture and popular culture? How have education and language policies shaped Chinese cultural identities over the last century? What does it mean to be Chinese in a diaspora context? Secondary readings, primary documents, and video material chosen for analysis will provide students with important insights into the diverse factors that have been shaping contemporary Chinese culture. This course is conducted in English with no requirement of pior knowledge of Chinese language for students who take it for 9 units.
