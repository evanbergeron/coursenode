Additional readings include the prose and poetry of Oscar Wilde (on art and socialism), William Morris (on utopia and design), H. G. Wells (science fiction), Christine Rossetti (on sexuality and the market), Charles Dickens and other writers who will show us the connections between class warfare, sciences of nature, and the arts.",
