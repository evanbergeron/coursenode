      "description" : "SPRING 2013 82455/82744 Discourse Analysis in Spanish This course will provide students with a theoretical framework and analytic tools to investigate how Spanish speakers represent, construct and transform their social worlds. In particular, we will focus on language as a social practice through which power relations are maintained or challenged. We will analyze a variety of spoken and written texts to explore the discourse-semantic and lexico-grammatical features that Spanish users deploy to make meanings and negotiate understandings. This analysis will later be interpreted from an interdisciplinary perspective drawing on social theory and history. The course is offered in Spanish. Prerequisite: Completion of 82-345 or permission of Instructor.",
