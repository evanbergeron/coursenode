      "description" : "This course will revolve around the role of sampling and sample surveys in the context of U.S. society and its institutions. We will examine the evolution of survey taking in the United States in the context of its economic, social and political uses. This will eventually lead to discussions about the accuracy and relevance of survey responses, especially in light of various kinds of nonsampling error. Students will be required to design, implement and analyze a survey sample.",
