      "description" : "This course is specially designed for students who are not true beginners of Spanish, and would not be appropriately placed in 82-141, but may also lack adequate preparation to enter the second semester of first-year Spanish. It can also serve students who have not completed the equivalent of the second-semester of Spanish, and would not be appropriately placed in 82-241, the Intermediate Spanish I course. Students in 82-147 will engage in a rapid review of first-semester Elementary Spanish materials and then progress to complete the entire elementary level of Spanish (the second semester) in one semester. Upon successful completion, students will be prepared to continue at the intermediate level. The course emphasizes the development of communicative proficiency though oral practice, aural comprehension, reading, writing, and study of cultural aspects of Spanish-speaking countries. Prerequisite: Permission of the Instructor and an appropriate placement exam score.",
