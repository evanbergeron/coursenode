      "description" : "Near the start of the 20th Century, Bertrand Russell helped to create what today we call &#8220;Analytic Philosophy.&#8221; We will study Russell&#8217;s contributions to this important approach to Philosophy by using his 1912 book, &#8220;The Problems of Philosophy&#8221; as a springboard to other readings. The issues we&#8217;ll cover include several specific challenges in the Theory of Knowledge and Perception. For example, What is the difference between appearance and reality, and can we tell? Also, we&#8217;ll consider issues that stem from reflecting on our thinking. For example, What constitutes a philosophical question?.",
