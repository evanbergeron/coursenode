      "description" : "Language credit may be attached to any course, independent study, or project unit for which a student receives content-area academic credit. The program is available at the discretion of the responsible content-area faculty, who should be sufficiently skilled in the chosen language to be able to evaluate the technical content of a student's work. The student, content-area faculty and language faculty negotiate a plan for the semester's work, designed to consume approximately three hours per week for three units of academic credit. The course may be repeated on multiple occasions. Prerequisites: Intermediate level language proficiency or above and permission of a content-area faculty member and the Department of Modern Languages.",
