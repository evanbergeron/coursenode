In this course, we will look at some of the many definitions of what a university is, as well as some current reports on and data about higher education. We will also read a number of novels and view several films that portray college and try to discern what definition of the university they convey. Novels will include Stover at Yale, Wonder Boys, and Admission, among others. We will read them alongside historical and philosophical work about higher education. In addition, you will write a series of short papers relating to the history, image, and current problems of the university.",
