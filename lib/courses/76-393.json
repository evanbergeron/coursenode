      "description" : "Rhetoric has traditionally been the study of the relationship between words and action, with persuasion as its central concern. As one of the oldest academic disciplines in the West, rhetoric has provided concepts, models, and systems for understanding how we use words to do things. In this course, we will examine various approaches to rhetoric in light of recurring questions about its definition, legitimacy, function, and methods. Specifically, we will be interested in some of the following questions: How does persuasive communication take place? How is persuasive communication influenced by various cultural, social, and political phenomena? How can we apply rhetorical concepts to current social and political problems? We will also be interested in how these questions relate to particular examples of rhetorical practice, such as Gorgias's Encomium of Helen, Thoreau's Civil Disobedience, and more recently, Michael Moore's film, FAHRENHEIT 9/11. Assignments will include a take-home midterm and final, as well as a final paper.",
