      "description" : "Would coming to CMU and not studying Shakespeare seem like going to the Sistine Chapel and not looking up? In 1878, Andrew Carnegie left his growing steel empire to sail around the world. Content to leave his business, he was not content to leave his 13-volume set of Shakespeare&#8217;s complete works. He later wrote: &#8220;I have read carefully eleven of Shakespeare's plays during the spare hours of the voyage&#8221;They are such gems. I&#8221;feel as if I have made new friends, whose angel visits will do me good in days and nights to come&#8221;every thing has its &#8216;environment,&#8217; and Shakespeare is the environment of all English-speaking men.&#8221; Much has changed since Carnegie wrote those words, as Joss Whedon&#8217;s Much Ado About Nothing, for example, will surely attest. But many still hunger for an introductory course like this one course on &#8220;the Bard.&#8221; Our reading list will include famous and exuberant plays such as Much Ado, A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream, As You Like It, The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter&#8217;s Tale, and The Tempest. Othello, a tragedy, will help us give focused attention to questions of genre by way of counterpoint. Plots, jokes, conventions, and contexts&#8212;we&#8217;ll discuss them all. Students at the end of the course should expect to have a good grounding in the language, themes, and characters of Shakespearean comedy and romance and perhaps more importantly be equipped to think carefully about Shakespeare&#8217;s plays in relation to poetics, history, politics, and genre. In addition to regular short writing exercises of varying types, assignments will include one close reading paper, a longer research paper, and performance of a scene.",
