      "description" : "The course considers the secret lives of every day things &#8212; like food, water, and oil. It suggests that it is by understanding these things that we can best address some of the greatest challenges facing our generation including world poverty and environmental problems. After a short introduction to arguments and ethical theory, the course considers how basic commodities like oil, water, and bananas have shaped and will continue to shape human and natural history. The course then outlines some of the environmental and social implications of the ways we create, use, and trade basic commodities. Finally, it considers prospects for dealing with some of the challenges posed by our past, present, and future use of these commodities. Global Economics and Ethics lays the groundwork for dealing with some of the most important issues facing our generation.",
