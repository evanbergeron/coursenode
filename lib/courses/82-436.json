C. which still persists as a living medium of expression today. The course aims to introduce students to the basic syntactic patterns of Classical Chinese and the most frequently used Classical Chinese vocabulary. In the course, we will read representative selections from ancient Chinese texts, chosen for their historical value, beauty,, and influence on later writers. With this knowledge and training, students will be sufficiently equipped to read the Chinese Classics and will gain a deeper understanding of the history of Chinese civilization, culture and language. Moreover, knowledge of Classical Chinese will help students read and understand sophisticated modern Chinese texts, which make frequent use of Classical allusions and constructs.
