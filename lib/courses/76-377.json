      "description" : "Wayne Booth's book, The Rhetoric of Fiction, is one of the classic discussions of the ways in which fiction communicates, moves, or motivates us. It is a commonplace to assume that literature has a message, but it is still not at all clear just how an imaginative representation of the world does, or can, communicate. Booth had particular difficulty understanding how fiction could communicate a felt sense of life and value when there was doubt about narrative authority, or the 'reliability' of the author. So, postmodern fiction (from Joyce on) caused him problems. In an attempt to develop a postmodern rhetoric of fiction we shall be looking at texts that deal directly with issues of persuasion, or texts that seem directly to address the reader. Of particular interest will be texts that indirectly implicate the reader, and achieve a kind of implicit rhetoric even when they apparently frustrate normal expectations of communicative language (e.g. the apparent fact that the reader is also a character in Calvino's 'novel' if on a winters' night&#8221;). We'll consider the kinds of problems (and solutions to those problems) caused by excessive irony, by 'showing' rather than 'telling' and by the 'absent author,' in texts like Madame Bovary, Notes From Underground, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, etc.",
