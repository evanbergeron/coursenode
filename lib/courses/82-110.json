      "description" : "Students who pursue study of a less-commonly taught language that is not offered by the Department of Modern Languages may receive appropriate credit for their work if they demonstrate successful completion of their study at an approved institution of higher learning. The course may provide the option for individualized language instruction for students working at their own pace in consultation with an instructor using materials identified by the National Association of Self Instructional Language Programs. Courses must emphasize the development of oral-aural skills and introduce basic reading and writing. Students must be prepared to devote at least 15 hours per week to individual study in addition to the time spent each week in consultation with their instructor. Enrollment in the course is limited. Permission of the Department Head is needed to take this course.",
