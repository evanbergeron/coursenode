      "description" : "Contemporary science emerged in the 17th century from a series of dramatic innovations in theory and method that has come to be called the Scientific Revolution. Since then, science has been punctuated by repeated &#8216;revolutions&#8217; in which scientists have been forced to select among dramatically different frameworks for explaining the world: is the Earth or the sun at the center of the solar system? Do kinds of organisms develop from other kinds, or is each created independently? Is matter infinitely divisible or are all things made of atoms in a void? The way scientists choose one framework over another can tell us something about the nature of science. In this course, we will focus on episodes of scientific change to gain insight into a range of questions: Is scientific change governed by a single method or does each new revolution involve the invention of a new scientific method? How do scientists argue for the existence of unobservable processes, properties, or objects like atoms? In what way do these arguments differ from those of their ancient predecessors? What makes them compelling? We&#8217;ll begin our investigation by examining the overthrow of ancient Greek astronomy and physics by Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. We will then turn to a number of subsequent revolutions in other areas of science such as chemistry, geology, and evolutionary biology. Students will work with original texts by Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and others.",
