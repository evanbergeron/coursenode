      "description" : "This course is designed to help you explore possible writing-related careers as you gain workplace experience and earn academic credit. You&#8217;ll work on- or off- campus as an entry-level professional for 8-10 hours per week in a field of interest to you. You might, for example, intern with a local newspaper or magazine or radio or TV station, work for a publisher or political campaign, or do research and promotions for a non-profit agency associated with a cause you feel strongly about. Other possibilities include local hospitals, museums, theatre and other arts groups, software documentation firms and other groups needing technical writers and communications specialists, PR and ad agencies, law-related sites, and just about any place you can think of that requires writing and communication skills. Most of your class time for the course will be completed through work at your internship site &#8211; a minimum of 120 hours (8-10 per week) over the semester for 9 units of credit. As the academic component of the course, you'll keep a reflective journal and meet periodically with the internship coordinator to discuss your internship and related professional issues. You will be responsible for finding your own internship, but it is recommended that you set up a meeting with the instructor to talk about your interests and what opportunities are open to you. You should do this before registration week.",
