Example, Fall 2010: In the early decades of the twentieth century, Irish and British writers transformed literary representation, abandoning the certainty of Realism to delve into representations of the human subconscious resulting in fractured narratives in keeping with the uncertainty of that historically pivotal time. As conceptions of national identity were called into question with traumas associated with the First World War, Modernist writers attended to the tensions between wholeness and disintegration in the individual and in collective bodies. In Irish and British Modernism we will explore the tensions between illusions of a whole associated with political movements like nationalism and fascism and the disorienting though sometimes liberating forces of disintegration that surfaced in the essays, poetry, plays, novels and short stories of four Modernist writers: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, William Butler Yeats and T.S. Eliot. American Modernism will be offered in the spring, which will build off elements of this initial introduction to Irish and British Modernism. Requirements for this course will include active participation in class conversations, bi-weekly response papers and a fifteen to twenty page research paper.",
