      "description" : "This course will focus on the arts in society during the period of intense modernization that begins in the middle of the nineteenth century (the Second Empire in France), with an emphasis on the late nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century (approximately until the time of World War I [1914-1918]). We will read a wide range of literary, historical, and cultural works in an interdisciplinary, comparative perspective. Our focus is on the cultures of Western Europe and the U.S., with an emphasis on French, Anglo-Irish and English, and German works; the readings will be complemented by study of the visual arts, especially Impressionism and photography, theater, and opera. We will view some of the latter works on film and video, when available. Prerequisite: Freshman status.",
