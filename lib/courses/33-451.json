      "description" : "Open to all senior physics majors. May include research done in a research lab, extending the capabilities of a teaching lab, or a theoretical or computational physics project. The student experiences the less structured atmosphere of a research program where there is much room for independent initiative. Modern Physics Laboratory, 33-340, should precede this course, though it is not required. A list of research projects is available. The student must contact a faculty member and/or the Assistant Head for the Undergraduate Affairs before registering so that student project pairings can be set. Reports on results are required at end of semester.",
