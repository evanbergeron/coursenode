      "description" : "FALL 2013 The Rise of Power: Chinese Society and Officialdom Literature In surveys of Chinese college graduates, to become a government official always ranks among the top-five most desired jobs. At the same time, government officials are a major target of both admiration and ridicule in Chinese literature. &#8220;Officialdom literature&#8221; (guanchang wenxue) emerged in early twentieth century as a specific type of both fiction and non-fiction writing in China, but has really developed into a best-selling genre since the late 1990s. This class focuses on readings from recent examples of &#8220;officialdom literature&#8221; in the Chinese language. By learning about the work and lives of both model officials and corrupt officials from literary sources, students will better understand how social and economic change affect everyday life in Chinese society today and will be equipped with the vocabulary to manage life in China themselves. The class is conducted in Chinese. Prerequisite:82-332 or permission of the instructor",
