      "description" : "In this introductory class, taught by a working journalist, students will learn the fundamental skills of reporting, writing and copy editing. We'll start with the basics - judging newsworthiness, conducting research and interviews, then organizing the information into a concise, clear, accurate and interesting news story. Because the key to learning to write effectively is to practice the necessary skills, class emphasis - and much of your grade - will be based on seven writing assignments involving current events and covering various types of news writing. Through readings, assignments and class discussion, we'll tackle questions such as: What makes a story newsworthy? How does a reporter decide which points to emphasize? What are effective techniques for a successful interview? How does a journalist turn pages of scribbled notes into a coherent news story? : We'll do a lot of writing, but we'll also examine issues and trends affecting journalism today. We'll cover at least two live events and hear from local professionals about working in print, broadcast and public relations. We'll also look at how newer mediums - such as blogs, the internet, and cable news - shape and influence news reporting.",
