      "description" : "The focus of this course is an examination of the dynamic role that language plays in a multitude of social contexts throughout the world. The goal of the course is to develop students? sensitivity and awareness to the dual role of language both as a reflection of prevailing social attitudes and as a force that serves to perpetuate many social attitudes and roles. This complex relationship between language, society, culture and personal identity will be demonstrated by examining language use in a wide variety of speech communities throughout the world. The course will consider numerous diverse topics, all of which demonstrate implicit cultural differences and attitudes as manifested through language use. Examples of topics to be considered include standard versus vernacular languages; dialects and variation, language attitudes, bilingualism and multiculturalism in the United States and throughout the world; diglossia; language, literacy and education; non-verbal aspects of language use; gender-based differences in language and culture; socio-linguistic variables in the ethnography of speaking; language loss and language maintenance; politics, language planning and language policy and the impact of languages in contact. The course will be taught on a seminar basis and will involve regular fieldwork activities to bring the themes of the course to life. Prerequisite: None.",
