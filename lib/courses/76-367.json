      "description" : "Topics vary by semester. Fall 2013: The early part of the 20th century is often compared to the Renaissance as a time of massive literary innovation and production. This class will focus on a few novels by writers at the center of the invention of the modern literary world. Our goal will be to sharpen our reading skills and our understanding of a variety of experimental techniques in the novel. Henry James is often thought to be the source of modern ideas about fiction writing and was a powerful influence on all significant writers who followed him. D.H. Lawrence was a passionate critic of traditional novel forms, seeking a form more appropriate to the experiences of modern life. With his collaborator Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad developed the technique known as impressionism, a style intended above all, as he said, to make us see. He is known for the complexity of his narratives and his formal experiments. James Joyce is regarded as having perfected all of the formal possibilities of the novel, effectively exhausting the form. The reading list will include books of this sort: Henry James: The Bostonians, Joseph Conrad: Lord Jim:, D.H. Lawrence Lady Chatterley&#8217;s Lover, James Joyce: Ulysses, Virginia Woolf: To The Lighthouse (not the actual list, but like that).",
