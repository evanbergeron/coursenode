      "description" : "We will read most of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and his narrative poem Troilus and Criseyde (considered by some the first English novel). Our texts are in Middle English&#8212;Chaucer's language is odd-looking, but easily mastered. We will also read some brief accounts of 14th-century institutions and traditions (chivalry, religious life, marriage, etc.). Most class meetings will consist of discussions that examine these fictions in relation to the social conditions they imply and the tellers&#8217; stakes in the telling. While we are discussing the General Prologue, I will ask each of you to identify the pilgrim through whose eyes you will try to read each of the tales (in addition, of course, to seeing from your own vantage point). As the course goes on, you will become an expert on one of the social roles portrayed in Chaucer's fictional universe. Required are near-perfect attendance, steady participation, and three papers. Graduate students will meet for an extra hour a week, read additional materials, and write longer papers.",
