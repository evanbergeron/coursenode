      "description" : "Topics will vary by semester. Fall 2012: Today, television is 'old media.' But what was television like when it was 'new media?' In this course, we will think about how television transformed American culture. We will look at individual genres, like drama, sitcoms, westerns, variety shows, and game shows. We will watch I Love Lucy, I Remember Mama, The Goldbergs, The Milton Berle Show, Amos n Andy, Queen for a Day, The Phil Silvers Show, the western Cheyenne, The Honeymooners, Leave It to Beaver, and teleplays like Marty and A Man is Ten Feet Tall. We will think about the social and political history of television, including television and the Cold War, television and Civil Rights, and television and electoral politics. Ultimately, the framing question of this class will be a media studies question: how do media technologies change our lives, and how do they NOT change our lives? How is the television revolution similar to our current digital revolution? What can we learn about new media by studying old media?.",
