In particular, we will focus on language as a social practice through which power relations are maintained or challenged. We will analyze a variety of spoken and written texts to explore the discourse-semantic and lexico-grammatical features that Spanish users deploy to make meanings and negotiate understandings. This analysis will later be interpreted from an interdisciplinary perspective drawing on social theory and history. The course is offered in Spanish.",
