For Spring 2010 in Qatar, participants in this course will work with the Reach Out to Asia's Adult English Literacy (RAEL) program for migrant workers. In this course, students will attend class twice a week and spend three hours weekly teaching English in the literacy program. During the early weeks of the semester, students will read about and discuss best practices in adult education, and will familiarize themselves with the program&#8217;s objectives and outcomes and the migrant worker student population. The rest of the semester will be spent on preparing for each week&#8217;s teaching, teaching an adult literacy evening class, and reflecting upon the experience. Grade will be based on the student's participation in the program and the completion of a weekly journal and a final paper or project about their experience. Prerequisite: Permission of the instructor.",
