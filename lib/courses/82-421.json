      "description" : "This course, entirely in German, focuses particularly on short fiction such as fairy tales. The nineteenth century was the heyday of Romanticism, in which authors told fantastical tales like E. T. A. Hoffmann&#8217;s &#8220;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,&#8221; which was subsequently turned into a famous Christmas ballet by the Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Germany is particularly famous for its Romantic culture, and in fact tens of thousands of people all over the world get married every year to the music of German Romantic composers like Richard Wagner and Felix Mendelssohn (&#8220;Here Comes the Bride&#8221; and the Wedding March, respectively). For many, Romanticism achieved its purest expression in Germany. Students will be asked to participate actively in discussions of the reading, to write a series of short papers, to lead classroom discussion on one day, and to complete a final project of their choice.
