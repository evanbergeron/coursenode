      "description" : "In this course, we will study communication strategies of effective leaders &#8212; people who seek to promote change in various professional, political, or cultural contexts. The main goals of the course are to understand rhetorical challenges that leaders face in different fields, to examine the language they use, and to learn (through theory, analysis, and practice) the most effective rhetorical strategies that can empower a leader. By drawing on the literature from management, organizational communication, psychology, and rhetoric, we will address a set of questions that include: (1) What makes an effective leader? (2) How do leaders use language and for what purposes? (3) What rhetorical strategies can be most useful to leaders to achieve their goals? (4) What is the role of creativity in leadership, and especially in the leader&#8217;s use of language? We will mine the literature on leadership for theoretical insights on rhetoric. Students will be expected to lead discussions on readings, a midterm that synthesizes the readings, and a final project that reviews the literature and provides an annotated bibliography in some subfield of rhetorical leadership.",
