      "description" : "This course is modeled after the successful MSE studio and MSIT practicum experiences used in the ISR software engineering masters programs. Students will carry out a semester-long project for a real client in small teams. A few lectures at the beginning of the course will introduce the process, tools, and documents to be used in the course, all of which will be specified by the instructors. Throughout the project, groups will be mentored through weekly team meetings with faculty. Teams will make regular presentations on the following topics: risk management, project planning, requirements, architecture, detailed design, quality assurance, final product presentations, and reflections on the experience. Teams will also deliver documents on each of the above topics. Evaluation will be based on the in-class presentations, process and product documentation deliverables, how well the teams follow SE practices as judged by their mentor, and finally the client&#8217;s satisfaction with the product. Individual grades within a team will be influenced by peer reviews, individual reflection documents, mentor impressions, and presentation performance. Students will leave the course with a firsthand understanding of the software engineering realities that drive SE practices. They will have concrete experience with these practices, and will have engaged in active reflection on this experience. They will have teamwork, process, and product skills to support immediate competency in a software engineering organization, along with a deeper understanding that prepares them to evaluate the new processes and techniques they will encounter in the workplace.",
