      "description" : "This on-line course gives students an overview of the field of Cloud Computing, its enabling technologies, main building blocks, and hands-on experience through 4 projects utilizing a public cloud (Amazon Web Services). Cloud computing services are being adopted widely across a variety of organizations and in many domains. Simply, cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility. The course will introduce this domain and cover the topics of data centers, resource management, cloud storage, and programming models. As an introduction, we will discuss the motivating factors, benefits, challenges, and service models. Modern data centers enable many of the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm; hence, we will describe several concepts behind data center design and management. Next, we will focus on existing approaches for resource management including resource abstraction, sharing and virtualization technologies. Students will learn about different cloud storage concepts including data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. HDFS, PVFS, HBase, Cassandra and S3 will be presented as examples of underlying distributed file systems. Students will understand the details of the MapReduce programming model and gain a broad overview of alternative programming models such as Pregel, and GraphLab. Students will work with a public cloud service (such as Amazon Web Services), use it to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications that run on these resources. Students will work with cloud storage systems and learn to develop applications in the MapReduce programming paradigm.",
