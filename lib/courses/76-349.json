      "description" : "Before the Beat Generation there was the Lost Generation. Both moments of literary history have an important relevance for our time, and both produced many major literary works. The 20s, like the 50s and 60s, were marked by the effects of World War. Gertrude Stein seems to have started the whole generation naming fad with her comment to Hemingway, 'You are the lost generation.' Paul Fussell identifies the cultural effect of WWI as the production of 'irony' as the central quality of modern identity (Some Beat writers make a similar claim for the effects of WWII). This class is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Beat writers class; it is related in theme but focused on different writers and texts. Students might consider taking this class as a point of entry to 'The Beat,' or might consider this class as a follow-on to 'The Beat' in order to understand more fully some of the central literary and historical issues of our time. In both cases we focus on the intersection between cultural change and major war. The Lost Generation class might include, for example, work by Stein, Hemingway, W.B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, the major War Poets, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Graves, Vera Brittain, and Evelyn Waugh.",
