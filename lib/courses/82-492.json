      "number" : "82-492",
      "units" : 9,
      "description" : "Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy all ruminated upon their nation&#8217;s historical destiny. This course aims to describe the role played by imagination in these authors&#8217; efforts to wreak from Russia&#8217;s past a vision of her future. Emphasis is placed upon the figurative operations of language that allow narrative to function as a guidepost to a collective mission and a map of the individual&#8217;s location within the projected historical scheme. Lecture and discussion formats are combined at each class meeting. Written papers, oral presentations, and participation in discussions are required. Prerequisites: None for 9 units; an additional 3 units, requiring permission of the instructor, can be earned for work done in Russian.",
