      "description" : "82335 Readings in Chinese: Traditional Chinese Thoughts and Literature through Comic Books and Animation This course was inspired by a comic book series created by Tsai Chih Chung in the 1980&#8217;s , which illustrate canonical works in traditional Chinese philosophy and literature. Ever since it was published, the comic book series has become a great hit in Taiwan and Mainland China, and has been translated into different languages around the world. While its popularity continues to grow among its readers, its wide circulation also raises questions among scholars and critics of traditional Chinese literature and culture. Two questions are usually brought up in the discussion of the value of this comic book series: (1) Are the comic adaptations faithful to the meanings of the original Chinese works? (2) Does the popularity of this comic series really help to promote the understanding and transmission of traditional Chinese culture? One goal of this course is to look into these two questions. In this course, students will be asked to read Tsai Chih Chung&#8217;s comic books and their animated adaptations, as well as the English translations of the Chinese canonical texts of philosophy and literature. While enjoying Tsai&#8217;s innovative and delightful comic interpretation, students will also need to ponder upon serious philosophical questions along with the early Chinese thinkers, to learn to savor the aesthetic beauty of traditional Chinese literature, and to prepare to share their ideas and discovery to the rest of the class in Chinese.",
