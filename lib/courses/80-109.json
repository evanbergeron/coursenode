      "description" : "The earth's climate has gone through many changes. Sorting through all the predictions and discussion about the changes in climate this generation will experience can be overwhelming. In this course we will look at questions about how to respond to climate change from several perspectives: history of the earth sciences, philosophy of science (what can we know?, how do we know?, what should we ask next?), and philosophical ethics. Answering such questions well relies in part on getting the facts straight, so we will also look at what scientists have to say on some relevant questions, such as: Has life on the earth ever recovered from a rapid catastrophic climatic event, and if so, how? What role do plants and animals, forests and deserts, oceans and marshlands play in creating and maintaining earth's atmosphere? Then we will consider ethical issues, such as: What should we aim for: mitigation of climate change or adaptation to climate change &#8212;- or both? How much should the interests of future generations be valued in making decisions today. and what principles or considerations are relevant in deciding this? Is it still worth pursuing global cooperation, or should such efforts instead focus on more regionally oriented aims? Are there successful stories of responding to climate change, and if so, what morals can we draw from them?.",
