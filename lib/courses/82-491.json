      "description" : "This course aims to familiarize the student with the cultural geography of contemporary East Europe, including Russia. Visual texts serve to outline the power politics that have shaped East European and Russian/Soviet cultures from World War II to the present, dramatic day, while verbal texts reveal a range of personal responses to current crises affecting national identity, human rights, gender roles, and the natural environment. While the first of these is the predominant concern of the course, the other three attract a good deal of attention as they take shape in the modes of cultural discourse by which national identities are formulated. The course seeks to sample this discourse mainly in fictional literature and feature film; however, a small number of nonfiction essays and documentary films are seen to demonstrate the breakdown of traditional genres that characterizes intellectual production in times of political flux. Prerequisites: None for 9 units; an additional 3 units, requiring permission of the instructor, can be earned for work done in Russian.",
