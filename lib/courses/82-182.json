      "description" : "This course will explore the relationship between language and culture as it manifests itself in language use in a wide variety of speech communities throughout the world. The purpose of the course will be to demonstrate the multifaceted and complex relationship between language and culture and how language use both exemplifies cultural values and simultaneously serves to reinforce them. The course will consider a wide variety of topics, all of which demonstrate implicit cultural differences and attitudes as manifested through language use. Illustrative examples include analysis of the relationship between language and thought (the Sapir-Whorf linguistic relativity hypothesis); standard versus vernacular languages; attitudes toward language acquisition as it differs from one speech community to another; bilingualism and multiculturalism in this country and throughout the world; diglossia; language, literacy and education; non-verbal aspects of language use; gender-based differences in language and culture; sociolinguistic variables in the ethnography of speaking; language loss and language maintenance; politics, language planning and language policy and the impact of languages in contact.
