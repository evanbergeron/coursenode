      "description" : "This seminar focuses on the role of diverse affective, cognitive and social factors in second language learning. All participating students are required to be studying an additional language while taking this seminar. Each class is devoted to discussion of assigned readings as well as to completion of various measures, inventories or questionnaires that assess diverse predictors of second language learning. These data are collected throughout the term, and then analyzed and related to predictions based upon previous research that have been discussed in class. Each student also identifies a &#8220;good&#8221; or a &#8220;poor&#8221; second language learner to interview and then report back to the class on the learners&#8217; characteristics. Co-requisite: Study of a foreign language.",
