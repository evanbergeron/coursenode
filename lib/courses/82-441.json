      "description" : "SPRING 2013 Panoramic Bodies: A dissection of twentieth century peninsular texts This course is part of the post-intermediate, 400-level program that forms the basis for the major or minor in Spanish. During this course we will consider various texts that serve to develop definitions of the Spanish body and, in turn, the Spanish identity of the Twentieth century. From Vel&#225;zquez and Goya to Picasso and Dal&#237;, the Spanish body has been employed to communicate the grotesque, distorted and abnormal. These plastic images are also reflected in other texts such as the novels, poems and essays of Cervantes, Quevedo, B&#233;cquer and Gald&#243;s. A brief historical introduction into those texts contributing to an explanation of the Spanish body will serve to set the basis for an in depth analysis of how this foundation continues, is broken or is distorted in the Twentieth century. Through a panorama of texts, from film, essay and novel, to art, installation and architecture, this course will study the body as related to its political, social, emotional and psychological surroundings. That is, we will examine texts in order to further understand the Spanish body and by doing so further comprehend the Spanish identity. Prerequisite: Completion of 82-345 or permission of Instructor.",
