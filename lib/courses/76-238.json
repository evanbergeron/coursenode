      "description" : "Topics will vary by semester. Spring 2013: When we reflect on the role of media in our lives, we ought to consider both their meanings and functions. Media objects like advertisements, newspapers, and television shows all have various meanings for audiences, but they also serve central - and sometimes very different - functions in our economy, our democracy, and our everyday lives. The course will offer students a survey of various ways of understanding media objects, including aesthetic, formalistic, ideological, and economic approaches media. Students will practice their interpretation by encountering media objects like the classic 1939 propaganda film The Middleton Family at the New York World's Fair, simultaneously a scandalous love story, a reassuring American myth, a piece of self-serving public relations for the Westinghouse company, and a determined apologia for capitalism produced at the height of the New Deal era. Other visual media that we will analyze will include films like Network (Sidney Lumet, 1976) as well as smaller-scale objects like advertisements and internet "front pages." Interpretive and critical secondary texts will feature works by scholars like Theodor Adorno, Marshall McLuhan, John Berger, Raymond Williams, Noam Chomsky, and Mark Crispin Miller.",
