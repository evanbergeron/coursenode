      "description" : "This course introduces basic issues in design and verification of modern digital systems. Topics include: Boolean algebra, digital number systems and computer arithmetic, combinational logic design and simplification, sequential logic design and optimization, register-transfer design of digital systems, basic processor organization and instruction set issues, assembly language programming and debugging, and a hardware description language. Emphasis is on the fundamentals: the levels of abstraction and hardware description language methods that allow designers to cope with hugely complex systems, and connections to practical hardware implementation problems. Students will use computer-aided digital design software and actual hardware implementation laboratories to learn about real digital systems. 3 hr. lec., 1 hr. rec., 3 hr. lab.",
