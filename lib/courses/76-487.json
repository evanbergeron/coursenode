      "description" : "As the Internet has increasingly become an integral part of professional and technical communication in all organizations, writers entering the workplace are expected to have a broad range of web design skills to complement their expertise in writing and design for print. Thus, we've designed this course to help writers learn the broad range of skills needed to develop communication materials that are tailored for the web. In particular, the course focuses on the planning, design, and testing of the visual and verbal content typical of contemporary websites. As a member of the class, you&#8217;ll participate in a guided, semester-long web design project, which is scaffolded with a series of group and individual assignments. The project begins with an introduction to user-centered methods for understanding the audience (users), where you will learn and practice foundational user-centered design methods through readings and a series of hands on exercises, including interviews, and observation of actual users. You will also learn theories and methods for developing effective information architecture, including organizational schemes, navigational design, labeling, form design, and visual design. Working in groups with other students, you will, over the course of the semester, develop a prototype of a small website, which will be evaluated through user testing at the end of the semester. While we focus primarily on the activities described above, we&#8217;ll also discuss sound and animation, emerging technologies such as Web 2.0 and Mobile Web, and social media.",
