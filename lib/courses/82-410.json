      "description" : "In this course, students will study the core curriculum of the 82-305 course, which is to say, a focus on culture through language variation in spoken and written forms of French. Readings, videos, web use, and in-class conversations involve phonological and sociolinguistic aspects of the French language and language change; its use regarding different registers and regional languages within France; the question of social identity through language; immigration and generational issues; and an exploration of the distinctive francophone uses of the French language. In order to achieve these goals, students do personal work on improving their control of the French phonological system, and discuss current issues in France and francophone regions/countries by using multimedia tools available in the Modern Language Learning Resource Center (MLRC). For students in the advanced level of this 305 core curriculum, a research project showing the application and intellectual development of one or several of the concepts described above is required. The project involves a written work of a minimum of 15 pages plus bibliography and a 10-minute oral presentation to the class, both in French. Prerequisites: 82303 or 82-304",
