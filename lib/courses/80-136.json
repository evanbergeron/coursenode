      "description" : "The course will consider ethical questions that arise regarding social structure and public policy&#8217;s impact on both people and the environment. It will consider the role of political institutions (and, sometimes, individuals) in dealing with some of the greatest challenges facing our generation: World poverty, environmental problems, and globalization. Some of the questions we will consider include: Are developed countries like ours obligated to ameliorate poverty by providing foreign aid, are they obligated to prevent environmental problems, and is globalization and free trade in particular a good idea? The course uses theory, case studies, and empirical evidence to consider these questions from a few different moral and political perspectives. We will extract some economic principles and rational dilemmas from examining these issues and pay attention to how legal and empirical considerations interact with ethical considerations.",
